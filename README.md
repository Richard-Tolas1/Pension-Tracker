Pension Tracker Application

üöÄ Overview

The Pension Tracker is a user-friendly web application designed to help individuals visualize their projected pension pot. Users can input key financial details, including desired retirement income, employer and personal contributions, and retirement age. The application then calculates and displays a visual projection of their pension fund's growth during accumulation and its subsequent decrease during retirement, providing a clear overview of their financial future.

‚ú® Features
Customizable Retirement Income: Users can specify their desired annual income in retirement.

Contribution Tracking: Input fields for both employer and personal monthly pension contributions.

Age-Based Projections: Define current age and desired retirement age to see projections tailored to individual timelines.

Interactive Visualizations: A dynamic line chart provides a clear visual representation of:

Projected pension pot growth (accumulation phase).

Projected pension pot decrease (decumulation phase).

Desired lump sum needed at retirement to achieve the target income.

"Calculate Pension" Button: Explicitly triggers the calculation and chart update, providing control over when projections are refreshed.

üìà Stretch Goals Implemented
Annual Interest Rate: The pension pot benefits from an assumed annual interest rate of 4.9%.

Existing Pension Pots: Users can add multiple current pension pots, which are factored into the initial balance and overall projection.

Contribution Visualization: The total contribution from existing pots is displayed in the summary, highlighting their impact.

‚öôÔ∏è Assumptions
Life Expectancy: The application assumes the user will live to 81 years old.

Job Duration: For simplification, it's assumed the user maintains their current job (and contributions) from their currentAge until their chosen retirementAge.

Fixed Interest Rate: The 4.9% annual interest rate is constant throughout the projection period and does not account for market fluctuations.

No Inflation/Taxation: The projections do not account for inflation or tax implications on contributions, growth, or withdrawals.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
React (v18+): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, providing type safety and improved developer experience.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

Recharts: A composable charting library built with React and D3, used for interactive data visualizations.

Vitest: A blazing fast unit test framework powered by Vite, used for testing the application's components and logic.

@testing-library/react: A set of utilities for testing React components in a way that simulates user interactions.

@testing-library/jest-dom: Provides custom Jest matchers to extend expect for more declarative DOM assertions.
